# MultiFASTAChecker
A quick script for visualising sequence lengths in Multi FASTA files.  Graphs the lengths using Plotly, colours sequences with lengths more than 2 Standard Deviations from the average differently and gives the option of setting high- and low- pass limits for sequence lengths in the output file.
